                    <p>ITP Venture Mentors achieve their highest satisfaction in the success of the Intrapreneurs who complete the program.</p>
                    <p>Whether success is becoming funded after Demo Day and going on to become a rapidly growing startup with the commercial relationships and equity investment of their previous employer, or whether it is being promoted to a high profile "Intrapreneurial" role within the Enterprise after completing an intensive and immersive Intrapreneur Accelerator in Silicon Valley, New York, LA, London, Singapore, Tel Aviv, or Berlin.</p>
                    <p>In addition, ITP Venture Mentors receive a share of an option pool comprised of every startup in the cohort they participated in as Mentors. The share allocation is based on the ranking of Mentors by the Intrapreneur startup teams, thus fostering 360 &deg; accountability.</p>
